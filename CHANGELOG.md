## Ki-kernel v1.6.1 (Beta-Test) :
- Upgraded Compiler Optimization to -O3 (`CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE_O3=y`) for aggressive loop unrolling, SIMD auto-vectorization, and superior instruction per clock (IPC) execution
- Enabled Native ARMv8.2-A Architecture Extensions (`-march=armv8.2-a+crypto+dotprod`) to leverage hardware crypto engines and dot-product vector computation units on Snapdragon 870
- Optimized Kryo 585 / Cortex-A77 Instruction Pipeline (`-mtune=cortex-a77`) for lower CPU execution latency and smoother 120 FPS frame pacing
- Added Zero-Overhead Fast-Path Flags (`-fno-builtin-bcmp` and `-fomit-frame-pointer`) to free up general-purpose arm64 registers for active computation
- Embedded Native AArch64 Static `keycheck` Binary in AnyKernel3: Directly polls Linux input event nodes to guarantee instantaneous physical volume button response in TWRP/OrangeFox
- Moved Interactive GPU Profile Selector before `flash_boot` with 15-second timeout for seamless profile choice (OC 683 MHz UV vs Stock 670 MHz)
- Fixed Recovery OS Detection for ColorOS / OxygenOS / RealmeUI ports by mounting `/system_root` and checking `ro.system.build.fingerprint` and `/system_root/my_product` prior to vendor region checks
- Fixed Overnight Sleep of Death (SoD) by tuning memory watermark safety buffers (`watermark_scale_factor=100`) and using non-blocking rwsem trylocks in `ki_profile`
- Protected Dynamic Fsync Screen-Off flush with a dedicated kernel `wakeup_source` to prevent I/O state D hangs during suspend
- Silenced Screen-Off Highpri Workqueue loops in `ki_profile` to prevent deep sleep aborts and timer wakeups
- Restored selective UID-based SELinux enforcing spoof for OPlus ports to prevent hardware service denials
- Fully migrated to standalone non-fork GitHub repository at `Luckyfr1945/ki-kernel-for-munch` on branch `beta-test`

## Ki-kernel v1.6.0 :
- Fixed Binder Page Allocation Failure & Overnight Sleep of Death (SoD): Increased default `watermark_scale_factor` from 20 to 100 to ensure an ~80MB safety buffer between MIN and LOW watermarks, unlocked sysctl clamping so ROMs can configure safe memory margins, and allowed `kswapd` across all online CPUs during sleep so background maintenance (dexopt, backup, sync) does not cause direct reclaim failure or freeze Binder IPC
- Fixed Sysfs Invalid Permissions Warning: Corrected `ki_profile` group attribute permissions from 0666 to 0664 to eliminate kernel call trace warnings on boot
- Added Interactive Volume Key Profile Selector in AnyKernel3: Prompted before flashing boot/vendor_boot to allow users to choose between OC + Undervolt (683 MHz GPU) via Vol(+) or Stock (670 MHz) via Vol(-) with reliable key event parsing (defaults to OC+UV after 15s or when flashed via app)
- Fixed Bypass Charging on ColorOS / OxygenOS: Ignored non-root / charger-hal-pol polling writes of '0' to bypass_charging and input_suspend in SMB5 driver, keeping bypass charging persistently active during gaming
- Fixed Sleep of Death (SoD) & ADB Offline on Screen Deep Eco (screen_off_battery): Replaced blocking down_write with down_write_trylock on cpufreq policy rwsem to eliminate deadlocks with secondary CPU offlining during system suspend
- Fixed Screen-Off Requeue Storm: Silenced highpri_wq 50ms requeue loops in ki_profile when display is asleep and secondary cores are offline, eliminating timer wakeups and deep sleep aborts
- Fixed Sleep of Death & PCIe Wi-Fi Crash on Weekclock (Boeffla Wakelock Blocker): Removed wlan_pno_wl and wlan_extscan_wl from default blocked wakelocks and whitelisted wlan, pno, dwc3, and usb in is_critical_wakelock() to protect active PCIe Wi-Fi PNO scans and prevent ADB going offline during idle
- Fixed Dynamic Fsync Screen-Off Suspend Hang: Protected ksys_sync() with a kernel wakeup_source (dyn_fsync_ws) so the device cannot enter deep suspend while storage flush is executing, eliminating UFS I/O state D hangs
- Ported task_is_critical() (oom_score_adj <= -900) to mm/vmscan.c to skip direct reclaim throttling on SurfaceFlinger, display composer, and camera (eliminates video stuttering, camera lag, and UI rendering stalls)
- Optimized OPlus Enforcing Spoofing in selinuxfs.c targeting Play Integrity / GMS and user apps while preserving permissive state for system service daemons to prevent hardware service denials (URCC, RIL, camera, audio, sensors)
- Fixed AnyKernel3 auto-detection order: Checks recovery system fingerprint (ro.system.build.fingerprint), /system_root/my_product, and system build.prop before checking vendor region to guarantee ColorOS / OxygenOS / RealmeUI ports are never misdetected as MIUI
- Added 2000ms debounce (KI_PSY_SETTLE_MS) in power supply notifier to eliminate SMB5 IRQ storms and severe thermal/profile throttling lag when connecting a charger
- Added 2-second debounce in ki_daemon bypass charging controller to eliminate charger flapping during plug-in
- Removed kernel-side vm_swappiness overrides in ki_profile to let ROM defaults manage swap behavior
- Disabled CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN in defconfig to eliminate useless task traversal overhead
- Completely eliminated redundant ki_profile dmesg log spam by tracking last applied profile mode
- Fixed screen-off suspend aborts (alarmtimer.0.auto error -16) by lengthening daemon poll interval to 10s when display is asleep (fixes heavy battery drain)
- Optimized daemon polling lifecycle (1.5s during gaming, 3.0s during regular usage, 10.0s when screen is off)
- Corrected MGLRU presets in WebUI (Mode 1: Safe/Gaming vs Mode 7: Aggressive/Multitasking) to prevent page-table lock stalls while gaming
- Added Fast Reboot (Zygote restart) in WebUI for AOSP with automatic detection and safe reboot on HyperOS/MIUI
- Added Android system notifications when Game Turbo activates and deactivates

## Ki-kernel v1.5.1 :
- Tuned Balanced profile WALT migration margins to 90/82 (fixed severe FPS drop & stutter in 120Hz/90Hz)
- Raised Balanced profile down-rate hold duration (down_us) to 5000us (5ms) to eliminate mid-frame dips
- Accelerated Balanced profile ramp-up (up_us) to 850us / 2850us / 3850us for smooth touch response
- Optimized Balanced hispeed load thresholds to 82% / 82% / 84% for responsive mid-load transitions
- Added modest I/O wait boost (iowait_boost_max = 5) in Balanced mode to eliminate storage lag
- Retained 1.80GHz / 2.05GHz / 2.36GHz frequency ceilings in Balanced profile for maximum thermal comfort
- Fixed Auto Game Turbo toggle lifecycle bug in WebUI & Ki-Daemon (prevented toggling back ON)
- Added native 'ki_daemon start' command to spawn detached background processes without external nohup dependency
- Implemented graceful pause state (DAEMON_ENABLED=0) in Ki-Daemon instead of abrupt SIGKILL/stale PID traps
- Added instant status file generation with 0666 permissions on Ki-Daemon startup to prevent WebUI race conditions
- Expanded built-in Auto Game Turbo game detections (Sky: Children of the Light, Free Fire MAX, Roblox, Minecraft, eFootball, CarX Street, Blood Strike, Honor of Kings, Honkai Impact 3, etc.)
